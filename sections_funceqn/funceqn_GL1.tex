In the previous section, we classified the prinicipal series representations of $G=\GL_2(F)$ over a non-Archimedean local field $F$. For characters $\chi$ of $\GL_1(F)$, Tate's thesis \cite{Tate} associates a space $\mathcal Z(\chi)$ of zeta functions in a complex variable $s$. This space will, in a sense to be made precise, be generated by a single element, the $L$-function $L(\chi,s)$. The zeta functions will also satisfy a functional equation depending on the `local constant' $\epsilon(\chi,s,\psi)$. Here $\psi :F \to \CC^\times$ is a character whose purpose is to fix a form of Fourier transform on $F$. These definitions and results in Tate's thesis are intended to mimic the classical theory of $L$-functions due largely to Hecke, which encompass the Riemann zeta function. The $L$-function and local constant of a character $\chi:F^\times \to \CC^\times$ will turn out to carry the essential information of $\chi$. In the classical setting see, for example, the converse theorem of Weil reproduced in \cite[Theorem 1.5.1]{Bump}.

In the setting of irreducible smooth representations $\pi$ of $G$, in particular the principal series representations $\pi$, we want to again associate a space $\mathcal Z(\pi)$ of zeta functions, an $L$-function $L(\pi,s)$ and a local constant $\epsilon(\pi,s,\psi)$ determining a functional equation. 

We begin this section with a brief review of harmonic and Fourier analysis and the role it plays in representation theory. For more details, see \cite[Chapter 3.1]{Bump}. Following the presentation in \cite{GH1}, we define the $L$-functions and local constants of characters of $F^\times$. We explain how this theory generalises to irreducible smooth representations $\pi$ of $G$, culminating in the Theorems \ref{BHThm1} and \ref{BHThm2}, which determine the functional equations satisfied by the zeta functions associated to $\pi$. Propositions \ref{prop:gl2factor} and \ref{prop:gl2gamma} prove these in the case where $\pi = \iota_B^G \chi$ is a principal series representation. The case where $\iota_B^G \chi$ is reducible, so that $\pi$ is only a subquotient, requires slightly more work. The results are summarised in Table 1. Finally, we prove a converse theorem for principal series representations of $G$.
