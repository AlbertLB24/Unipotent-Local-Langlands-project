We turn now to smooth representations $\pi$ of $G=\GL_2(F)$ and define the $L$-functions and local constants in an analogous manner to the characters $\chi :F^\times \to \CC^\times$. We proceed in a similar manner to the previous section; first we will construct the space of $\zeta$-functions $\mathcal{Z}(\pi)$ that will motivate the definition of the $L$-function $L(\pi,s)$. Afterwards, we will define the analogous notion of the Fourier transform in this context, and this will lead us to the statement and proof of the functional equation for $\GL_2$.
