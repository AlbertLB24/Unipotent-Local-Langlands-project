So far, we have introduced the central objects that we will study throughout: locally profinite groups and smooth representations. In addition, we have given a complete classification of the equivalence classes of irreducible smooth representations of a local field $F$. These are all $1$-dimensional by Schur's Lemma and therefore $\hat{F}\cong F$ by Additive Duality. 

However, the analogous task for other locally profinite groups is considerably harder. Even the structure of the group of characters of $F^{\times}$ is a lot more subtle. To describe the local Langlads correspondence for $\GL_2$ we will need a classification theorem of some family of irreducible smooth representations of $\GL_2(F)$ denoted as principal series representations. To advance in this task, however, we need to introduce the notion of Haar measure and develop some measure theory on locally profinite groups. This is precisely the aim of this chapter, which follows a similar development to \cite[Chapter 3]{BH1}.

We finish this section by studying the relationship between induction and duality, which is encapsulated by the Duality Theorem.
