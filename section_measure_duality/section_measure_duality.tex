So far, we have introduced the central objects that we will study throughout: locally profinite groups and smooth representations. In addition, we have given a complete classification of the equivalence classes of irreducible smooth representations of a local field $F$. These are all $1$-dimensional by Schur's Lemma, and we have Additive Duality, $\hat{F}\cong F$, by Theorem \ref{add_dual}. 

Classifying irreducible smooth representations of other locally profinite groups is considerably harder. Even the structure of the group of characters of $F^{\times}$ is more subtle. To describe the local Langlands correspondence for $\GL_2$, we will need a classification theorem of irreducible smooth representations of $\GL_2(F)$. We will focus on a particular family of them, the so-called principal series representations. In order to study the group $\GL_2(F)$ and its subgroups, we study certain functions defined on them. To do so, we must first develop some measure theory on locally profinite groups. This is precisely the aim of this chapter, which follows a similar development to \cite[Chapter 3]{BH1}.

We finish this section by studying the relationship between induction and duality, which is encapsulated by the Duality Theorem \ref{thm:duality}.
