The aim of this first section is to motivate the notions of locally profinite groups and their smooth representations. Such groups arise in nature from taking the points of reductive groups over non-archimedean local fields. We begin this section by briefly recalling some basic facts about these fields and linear groups associated to them. For the sake of brevity, we will omit proofs. For more detail, the reader can consult, for example, \cite{Gou1}.
