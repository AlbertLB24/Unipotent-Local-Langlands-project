The aim of this first section is to motivate the abstract notions of a \textit{locally profinite group} and of a \textit{smooth representation}, which will be the main objects of study during the later subsections. Most of the motivation for studying such groups comes from the study of representations of reductive groups over non-Archimedean local fields. Therefore, we begin this section by briefly recalling some basic facts about these fields and linear groups associated to them. For the sake of brevity, we will omit proofs, and therefore we assume familiarity with the subject. For the unfamiliar reader, we encourage them to read \textbf{(insert here Gouvea reference, or others)}, where a detailed explanation is provided.
